Hi. This is my first blog post.
I prepared this blog for myself because I have a thousand writing notebook pages I could never find where my notes are.

As a physicist, I try to do some research in Quantum Machine Learning and Quantum Computing methodology for optimization problems.
The second one is strictly connected with hybrid methods where you can use both classical (hyperparameters optymization) and quantum (circuit and parametric gates) methodology.
At work, I mostly use python programming language, and now I have a new challange with Julia.
My team colleagues gave me a task in with I had to teach them quantum physics, how to understand it and use it for graph optimization problems.
The first main problem is community detection or colouring of the graph.
We try to use this problem for outlier detection in artificially generated graphs in ABCDo.jl package.
As You see the spectrum of topics is huge so I think it will be the very interesting blog for you.
