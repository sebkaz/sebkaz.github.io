Hi. This is my first blog post. I prepared this blog for myself because I have a thousand writing notebook pages I could never find where my notes are.

As a physicist, I do some research in Quantum Machine Learning and Quantum Computing methodology for optimisation problems. The second one is strictly connected with hybrid methods, where you can use classical (hyperparameters optimisation) and quantum (circuit and parametric gates) methodology. At work, I mostly use python programming language, and now I have a new challenge with Julia. My team colleagues gave me a task in with I had to teach them quantum physics, how to understand it and use it for graph optimisation problems. The first main problem is community detection or colouring of the graph. We try to use this problem for outlier detection in artificially generated graphs in ABCDo.jl package.

As You see, the spectrum of topics is vast, and it will be an exciting blog for you.
